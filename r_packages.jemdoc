Below is a list of useful R packages that I regularly use:

- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/ data.table] - a faster way of working with data frames in R. Very useful  while working with very large datasets (>10 million records)

- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geosphere/ geosphere] - for working with GPS data
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lavaan/ lavaan] - for structural equation modeling (also check [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blavaan/ blavaan] for bayesian SEM)
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/ bsts] - for estimation of bayesian structural time series models (a.k.a state - space models)
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/imputeTS/ imputeTS] - for imputing missing data in time series
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Bergm/index.html Bergm] - for bayesian exponential randon graph models
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSiena/index.html RSiene], [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/relevent/index.html relevent],
